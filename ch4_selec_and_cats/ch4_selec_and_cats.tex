\section{Description}

A description of the selection and categorisation under two schemes Ð a robust cut-based driven approach (used later for the spin) and a highly optimized, standard model specific multivariate method (used later for the nominal analysis and the sideband background method). This would also include the validation procedure with Z->ee decays.
